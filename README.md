# To-do List

In this project, after learning advanced JS and a few design patterns we will be using it to create dynamic to-do lists with multi level projects each having their individual lists.

Skills learnt before starting the project are :
1. Module and constructor patterns, factory functions.
2. Webpack and bundling.
3. OOP principles and how to structure projects.
4. Advanced JS concepts such as scopes, closures and prototypical inheritance.
